(Or try asking me about another disease!)
You: what are the symptyms of malara
Bot: Symptoms for malaria usually start about 10-15 days after the infected mosquito bite. Along with high fever, shaking chills, and sweating, they can include:
Throwing up or feeling like you're going to
   - Headache
   - Diarrhea
   - Being very tired (fatigue)
   - Body aches
   - Yellow skin (jaundice) 
   - Kidney failure
   - Seizure
   - Confusion
   - Bloody stools
   - Convulsions
Here are some things to keep in mind:
   - Because the signs are so similar to cold or flu symptoms, it might be hard to tell what you have at first.
   - Malaria symptoms don’t always show up within 2 weeks, especially if it’s a P. vivax infection.
   - People who live in areas with lots of malaria cases may become partially immune after being exposed to it throughout their lives. But this can change if they move to a place where they’re not around the parasite.
